Cppcheck - A tool for static C/C++ code analysis

Syntax:
    cppcheck [OPTIONS] [files or paths]

If a directory is given instead of a filename, *.cpp, *.cxx, *.cc, *.c++, *.c,
*.tpp, and *.txx files are checked recursively from the given directory.

Options:
    --addon=<addon>
                         Execute addon. i.e. --addon=cert. If options must be
                         provided a json configuration is needed.
    --addon-python=<python interpreter>
                         You can specify the python interpreter either in the
                         addon json files or through this command line option.
                         If not present, Cppcheck will try "python3" first and
                         then "python".
    --bug-hunting
                         Enable noisy and soundy analysis. The normal Cppcheck
                         analysis is turned off.
    --cppcheck-build-dir=<dir>
                         Cppcheck work folder. Advantages:
                          * whole program analysis
                          * faster analysis; Cppcheck will reuse the results if
                            the hash for a file is unchanged.
                          * some useful debug information, i.e. commands used to
                            execute clang/clang-tidy/addons.
    --check-config       Check cppcheck configuration. The normal code
                         analysis is disabled by this flag.
    --check-library      Show information messages when library files have
                         incomplete info.
    --clang=<path>       Experimental: Use Clang parser instead of the builtin Cppcheck
                         parser. Takes the executable as optional parameter and
                         defaults to `clang`. Cppcheck will run the given Clang
                         executable, import the Clang AST and convert it into
                         Cppcheck data. After that the normal Cppcheck analysis is
                         used. You must have the executable in PATH if no path is
                         given.
    --config-exclude=<dir>
                         Path (prefix) to be excluded from configuration
                         checking. Preprocessor configurations defined in
                         headers (but not sources) matching the prefix will not
                         be considered for evaluation.
    --config-excludes-file=<file>
                         A file that contains a list of config-excludes
    --dump               Dump xml data for each translation unit. The dump
                         files have the extension .dump and contain ast,
                         tokenlist, symboldatabase, valueflow.
    -D<ID>               Define preprocessor symbol. Unless --max-configs or
                         --force is used, Cppcheck will only check the given
                         configuration when -D is used.
                         Example: '-DDEBUG=1 -D__cplusplus'.
    -E                   Print preprocessor output on stdout and don't do any
                         further processing.
    --enable=<id>        Enable additional checks. The available ids are:
                          * all
                                  Enable all checks. It is recommended to only
                                  use --enable=all when the whole program is
                                  scanned, because this enables unusedFunction.
                          * warning
                                  Enable warning messages
                          * style
                                  Enable all coding style checks. All messages
                                  with the severities 'style', 'performance' and
                                  'portability' are enabled.
                          * performance
                                  Enable performance messages
                          * portability
                                  Enable portability messages
                          * information
                                  Enable information messages
                          * unusedFunction
                                  Check for unused functions. It is recommend
                                  to only enable this when the whole program is
                                  scanned.
                          * missingInclude
                                  Warn if there are missing includes. For
                                  detailed information, use '--check-config'.
                         Several ids can be given if you separate them with
                         commas. See also --std
    --error-exitcode=<n> If errors are found, integer [n] is returned instead of
                         the default '0'. '1' is returned
                         if arguments are not valid or if no input files are
                         provided. Note that your operating system can modify
                         this value, e.g. '256' can become '0'.
    --errorlist          Print a list of all the error messages in XML format.
    --exitcode-suppressions=<file>
                         Used when certain messages should be displayed but
                         should not cause a non-zero exitcode.
    --file-filter=<str>  Analyze only those files matching the given filter str
                         Example: --file-filter=*bar.cpp analyzes only files
                                  that end with bar.cpp.
    --file-list=<file>   Specify the files to check in a text file. Add one
                         filename per line. When file is '-,' the file list will
                         be read from standard input.
    -f, --force          Force checking of all configurations in files. If used
                         together with '--max-configs=', the last option is the
                         one that is effective.
    -h, --help           Print this help.
    -I <dir>             Give path to search for include files. Give several -I
                         parameters to give several paths. First given path is
                         searched for contained header files first. If paths are
                         relative to source files, this is not needed.
    --includes-file=<file>
                         Specify directory paths to search for included header
                         files in a text file. Add one include path per line.
                         First given path is searched for contained header
                         files first. If paths are relative to source files,
                         this is not needed.
    --include=<file>
                         Force inclusion of a file before the checked file.
    -i <dir or file>     Give a source file or source file directory to exclude
                         from the check. This applies only to source files so
                         header files included by source files are not matched.
                         Directory name is matched to all parts of the path.
    --inconclusive       Allow that Cppcheck reports even though the analysis is
                         inconclusive.
                         There are false positives with this option. Each result
                         must be carefully investigated before you know if it is
                         good or bad.
    --inline-suppr       Enable inline suppressions. Use them by placing one or
                         more comments, like: '// cppcheck-suppress warningId'
                         on the lines before the warning to suppress.
    -j <jobs>            Start <jobs> threads to do the checking simultaneously.
    --language=<language>, -x <language>
                         Forces cppcheck to check all files as the given
                         language. Valid values are: c, c++
    --library=<cfg>      Load file <cfg> that contains information about types
                         and functions. With such information Cppcheck
                         understands your code better and therefore you
                         get better results. The std.cfg file that is
                         distributed with Cppcheck is loaded automatically.
                         For more information about library files, read the
                         manual.
    --max-ctu-depth=N    Max depth in whole program analysis. The default value
                         is 2. A larger value will mean more errors can be found
                         but also means the analysis will be slower.
    --output-file=<file> Write results to file, rather than standard error.
    --project=<file>     Run Cppcheck on project. The <file> can be a Visual
                         Studio Solution (*.sln), Visual Studio Project
                         (*.vcxproj), compile database (compile_commands.json),
                         or Borland C++ Builder 6 (*.bpr). The files to analyse,
                         include paths, defines, platform and undefines in
                         the specified file will be used.
    --project-configuration=<config>
                         If used together with a Visual Studio Solution (*.sln)
                         or Visual Studio Project (*.vcxproj) you can limit
                         the configuration cppcheck should check.
                         For example: '--project-configuration=Release|Win32'
    --max-configs=<limit>
                         Maximum number of configurations to check in a file
                         before skipping it. Default is '12'. If used together
                         with '--force', the last option is the one that is
                         effective.
    --platform=<type>, --platform=<file>
                         Specifies platform specific types and sizes. The
                         available builtin platforms are:
                          * unix32
                                 32 bit unix variant

                                 64 bit unix variant
                          * win32A
                                 32 bit Windows ASCII character encoding

                                 32 bit Windows UNICODE character encoding
                          * win64
                                 64 bit Windows
                          * avr8
                                 8 bit AVR microcontrollers
                          * elbrus-e1cp
                                 Elbrus e1c+ architecture
                          * pic8
                                 8 bit PIC microcontrollers
                                 Baseline and mid-range architectures
                          * pic8-enhanced
                                 8 bit PIC microcontrollers
                                 Enhanced mid-range and high end (PIC18) architectures
                          * pic16
                                 16 bit PIC microcontrollers
                          * mips32
                                 32 bit MIPS microcontrollers
                          * native
                                 Type sizes of host system are assumed, but no
                                 further assumptions.
                          * unspecified
                                 Unknown type sizes
    --plist-output=<path>
                         Generate Clang-plist output files in folder.
    -q, --quiet          Do not show progress reports.
    -rp=<paths>, --relative-paths=<paths>
                         Use relative paths in output. When given, <paths> are
                         used as base. You can separate multiple paths by ';'.
                         Otherwise path where source files are searched is used.
                         We use string comparison to create relative paths, so
                         using e.g. ~ for home folder does not work. It is
                         currently only possible to apply the base paths to
                         files that are on a lower level in the directory tree.
    --report-progress    Report progress messages while checking a file.
    --rule=<rule>        Match regular expression.
    --rule-file=<file>   Use given rule file. For more information, see:
                         http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppcheck/files/Articles/
    --std=<id>           Set standard.

    --suppress=<spec>    Suppress warnings that match <spec>. The format of
                         <spec> is:
                         [error id]:[filename]:[line]
                         The [filename] and [line] are optional. If [error id]
                         is a wildcard '*', all error ids match.
    --suppressions-list=<file>
                         Suppress warnings listed in the file. Each suppression
                         is in the same format as <spec> above.
    --suppress-xml=<file>
                         Suppress warnings listed in a xml file. XML file should
                         follow the manual.pdf format specified in section.
                         `6.4 XML suppressions` .
    --template='<text>'  Format the error messages. Available fields:

                         Example formats:
                         '{file}:{line},{severity},{id},{message}' or
                         '{file}({line}):({severity}) {message}' or
                         '{callstack} {message}'
                         Pre-defined templates: gcc (default), cppcheck1 (old default), vs, edit.
    --template-location='<text>'
                         Format error message location. If this is not provided
                         then no extra location info is shown.
                         Available fields:
                           {file}      file name
                           {line}      line number
                           {column}    column number
                           {info}      location info
                           {code}      show the real code
                           \t         insert tab
                           \n         insert newline
                           \r         insert carriage return
                         Example format (gcc-like):
                         '{file}:{line}:{column}: note: {info}\n{code}'
    -U<ID>               Undefine preprocessor symbol. Use -U to explicitly
                         hide certain #ifdef <ID> code paths from checking.
                         Example: '-UDEBUG'
    -v, --verbose        Output more detailed error information.
    --version            Print out version number.
    --xml                Write results in xml format to error stream (stderr).

Example usage:
  # Recursively check the current folder. Print the progress on the screen and
  # write errors to a file:
  cppcheck . 2> err.txt

  # Recursively check ../myproject/ and don't print progress:
  cppcheck --quiet ../myproject/

  # Check test.cpp, enable all checks:
  cppcheck --enable=all --inconclusive --library=posix test.cpp

  # Check f.cpp and search include files from inc1/ and inc2/:
  cppcheck -I inc1/ -I inc2/ f.cpp
